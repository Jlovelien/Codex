# Smart Home Dashboard

This repository contains the code for a React-based dashboard to manage and monitor IoT devices in a smart home. The project is bootstrapped using Vite with TypeScript. The dashboard now includes simple controls to toggle each device on or off.

## Development

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server with hot reloading.

## Production Build

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The build output will be generated in `frontend/dist`.
